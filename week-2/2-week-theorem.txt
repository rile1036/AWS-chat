1. Access to Linux

1) First you have to install the ssh related package.

   $ sudo apt-get install openssh-server

2) You need to modify the port number after installing openssh-server.

   $ cd /etc/ssh/
   
   You need to modify sshd_config inside

   $ vi sshd_config

   After entering, delete # from #port 22 and modify the port number to 10022.

3) You should set the Raspberry Pie2(RPI2) environment.    
   The first time you run ssh, the setting connects because the ssh configuration is closed.

   $ sudo raspi-config

   [5 Interfacing Options] choose, and [P2 SSH] choose.
   then, select <Yes> to connect.
   Sellect <Finish>, reboot RPI2.

4) After rebooting, ssh attempts to connect.

   $ ssh pi@localhost(You can also fill in ip address directly.)

   ip can be checked with ifconfig.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Intallation with apt-get

1) You need to edit the 'sourcee.list' file  

   $ cd /etc/apt

   Go into here and edit the file.

   $ vi sources.list

2) When editing a file,

   deb http:// archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/ stretch main contrib non-free rpi

   Delete # and write it like above. RPI2 does not support ftp.daum.net.
   This changes the apt-get reposity.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Account Management

1) Set the path and user account name to create the account.

   $ sudo useradd /home/embedded embedded

2) Reset the user account password.

   $ sudo passwd embedded

   When entering, a window for entering a new password appears.
   When you enter it, a password window to confirm is displayed.

3) You can login with your user account.

   $ su embedded

   When you type, you will be logged into your account.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Check System Information 

1) cat /FileAddress inputting, the contents of the file are output.

2) When you enter the 'awk' command, it searches for the corresponding pattern.

   -F Field separator : Used to specify a Field separator.
   -f File name : Load the script file.

   At this time, 'print $1 |(pipe) sort' will sort and print the first field.
    
   cat /etc/passwd | awk -F: '{print $1 | sort}'

   This will sort the first field inside the passwd file and display it on the screen.

3) cat /proc/cpuinfo | grep (cpu, processor)

   When 'grep' is used, it finds the corresponding word in the specified file 
   and prints the line with that word.
   
   This will print both the cpu in the cpuinfo file and the lines containing the processor word.

4) cat /proc/meminfo MemTotal shows the total memory capacity.
   
   When uname is used, system information is printed.

   -ra or -a prints in more detail. (The current RPI2 is using armv7.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Store System Information

   1) cat /proc/meminfo > ~/meminfo.txt 
   If you use '>', the contents output to the screen will be created as a file called meminfo.txt.


   2) cat /proc/cpuinfo >> ~/meminfo.txt 
   If you use '>>', the contents of the screen will be stored in the meminfo.txt file.
